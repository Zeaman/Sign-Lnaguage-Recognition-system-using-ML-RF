Sign language detection is an essential application of computer vision and machine learning techniques that can greatly improve communication and accessibility for individuals with hearing disabilities. By recognizing and interpreting the gestures and movements made by signers using their hands, face, and body, these techniques can help bridge the communication gap and enable effective interaction between deaf individuals and the hearing world.

In this project, we focused on using the Random Forest algorithm for sign language detection. Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. By randomly selecting a subset of features and data points to train each tree, it can avoid overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.

To prepare the dataset, we collected video recordings of individuals signing the first 10 letters of the alphabet using a webcam. We then extracted 100 frames from each video that contained only the hand region, which we resized to a fixed size of 64x64 pixels and converted to RGB format. We then stored these images as numpy arrays in a pickle file, which can be easily loaded and used for training the classifier.

We used scikit-learn to train the Random Forest classifier on this dataset. We randomly split the dataset into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing. We trained the classifier using 100 decision trees, with a maximum depth of 10 and a minimum of 2 samples required to split a node. We also used cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters of the model and avoid overfitting.

To evaluate the performance of the classifier, we used accuracy as the evaluation metric. Our results showed that the Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 100% on the testing set, indicating that it is highly effective in recognizing the signs for the first 10 letters of the alphabet. This high accuracy can be attributed to the use of a large dataset of RGB images, which allowed the classifier to learn robust features and patterns in the data.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm for sign language detection. By using a large dataset of RGB images prepared using the pickle library, we were able to achieve high accuracy in recognizing hand gestures and movements made by signers. This approach can be extended to recognize a larger set of signs and applied in real-world applications to improve accessibility for individuals with hearing disabilities.
